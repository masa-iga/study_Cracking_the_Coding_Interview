  Question:
    Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide detail about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problem to solve?

  How to approach:
    1. Handle ambiguity
    2. Define core classes
    3. Analyize relashinships
    4. Investigate actions
*/

/*
  Let's make assumption like these:
    - Imagine Skype
    -- Need a client software
    -- Login via account
    -- Friend/contact list
    -- Can chat not only with on-by-one, but also multiple persons at the same time
